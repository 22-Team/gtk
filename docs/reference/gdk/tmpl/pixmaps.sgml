<para>
Pixmaps are offscreen drawables. They can be drawn upon with the
standard drawing primitives, then copied to another drawable (such as
a #GdkWindow). The depth of a pixmap
is the number of bits per pixels. Bitmaps are simply pixmaps
with a depth of 1. (That is, they are monochrome bitmaps - each
pixel can be either on or off).

<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkPixmap ##### -->
<para>
An opaque structure representing an offscreen drawable.
Pointers to structures of type #GdkPixmap, #GdkBitmap,
and #GdkWindow, can often be used interchangeably. 
The type #GdkDrawable refers generically to any of
these types.
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gdk_pixmap_new ##### -->
<para>
Create a new pixmap with a given size and depth.
</para>

@drawable: A #GdkDrawable, used to determine default values
for the new pixmap. Can be %NULL if @depth is specified,
@width: The width of the new pixmap in pixels.
@height: The height of the new pixmap in pixels.
@depth: The depth (number of bits per pixel) of the new pixmap. 
  If -1, and @drawable is not %NULL, the depth of the new
  pixmap will be equal to that of @drawable.
@Returns: the #GdkPixmap


<!-- ##### TYPEDEF GdkBitmap ##### -->
<para>
An opaque structure representing an offscreen drawable of depth
1. Pointers to structures of type #GdkPixmap, #GdkBitmap, and
#GdkWindow, can often be used interchangeably.  The type #GdkDrawable
refers generically to any of these types.
