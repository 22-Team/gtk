  <title>Migrating from GTK+ 3.x to GTK+ 4</title>

  <para>
    GTK+ 4 is a major new version of GTK+ that breaks both API and ABI
    compared to GTK+ 3.x. Thankfully, most of the changes are not hard
    to adapt to and there are a number of steps that you can take to
    prepare your GTK+ 3.x application for the switch to GTK+ 4. After
    that, there's a small number of adjustments that you may have to do
    when you actually switch your application to build against GTK+ 4.

    <title>Preparation in GTK+ 3.x</title>

    <para>
      The steps outlined in the following sections assume that your
      application is working with GTK+ 3.22, which is the final stable
      release of GTK+ 3.x. It includes all the necessary APIs and tools
      to help you port your application to GTK+ 4. If you are still using
      an older version of GTK+ 3.x, you should first get your application
      to build and work with 3.22.

      <title>Do not use deprecated symbols</title>
      <para>
        Over the years, a number of functions, and in some cases, entire
        widgets have been deprecated. These deprecations are clearly spelled
        out in the API reference, with hints about the recommended replacements.
        The API reference for GTK+ 3 also includes an
        <ulink url="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.22/api-index-deprecated.html">index</ulink> of all deprecated symbols.
      </para>
      <para>
        To verify that your program does not use any deprecated symbols,
        you can use defines to remove deprecated symbols from the header files,
        as follows:
        <programlisting>
        make CFLAGS+="-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED"
        </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that some parts of our API, such as enumeration values, are
        not well covered by the deprecation warnings. In most cases, using
        them will require you to also use deprecated functions, which will
        trigger warnings.
