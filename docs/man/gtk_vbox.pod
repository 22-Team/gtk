gtk_vbox - GTK+ vertical box widget

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <gtk/gtkvbox.h>

 guint      gtk_vbox_get_type (void);
 GtkWidget* gtk_vbox_new      (gint homogeneous,
                               gint spacing);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This widget is a container used to place widgets vertically in relation
to each other.  This is done by "packing" them into the boxes with
the functions gtk_box_pack_start and gtk_box_pack_end.

General box functions can be found in gtk_box(1).

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Creation

To create a vbox, use the function gtk_vbox_new().  The arguments
you pass to gtk_vbox_new indicate if the vbox should be homogeneous
(that is, if the children should all be given the same amount of 
space all the time), and the amount of space inbetween the children.

The following creates a vbox which is non-homogeneous and will have
4 spacing pixels between the children:

	GtkWidget *vbox;
	vbox = gtk_vbox_new (FALSE, 4);

For instructions on adding children to this newly created vbox,
consult gtk_box(3).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

guint gtk_vbox_get_type (void);

	This function returns the GtkType which is assigned to the
	object class for gtk_vbox.

GtkWidget* gtk_vbox_new (gint homogeneous, gint spacing);

	This functions returns a new vbox widget which can then be
	used as a container for other widgets.  Homogeneous can be
	either TRUE or FALSE and indicates if the children widgets
	will be always be allocated equal area.  Spacing is the 
	number of pixels to put inbetween the children of the box.
