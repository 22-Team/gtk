 * @Short_description: Object representing a physical screen
 * @Title: GdkScreen
 *
 * #GdkScreen objects are the GDK representation of the screen on
 * which windows can be displayed and on which the pointer moves.
 * X originally identified screens with physical screens, but
 * nowadays it is more common to have a single #GdkScreen which
 * combines several physical monitors (see gdk_screen_get_n_monitors()).
 *
 * GdkScreen is used throughout GDK and GTK+ to specify which screen
 * the top level windows are to be displayed on.
