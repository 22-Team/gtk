/**
 * SECTION:gtkeventtracker
 * @Short_description: Tracks the events from a #GtkEventRecognizer
 * @Title: GtkEventTracker
 * @See_also: #GtkEventRecognizer
 *
 * The #GtkEventTracker object - or a subclass of it - is used to track
 * sequences of events as recognized by a #GtkEventRecognizer. Once the
 * recognizer finds it can potentially identify a sequence of events, it
 * creates a #GtkEventTracker and uses it to store information about the
 * event. See the event handling howto for a highlevel overview.
 *
 * #GtkEventTracker was added in GTK 3.6.
