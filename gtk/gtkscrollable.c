/**
 * SECTION:gtkscrollable
 * @Short_Description: An interface for scrollable widgets
 * @Title: GtkScrollable
 *
 * #GtkScrollable is interface that is implemented by widgets with native
 * scrolling ability.
 *
 * To implement this interface, all one needs to do is to override
 * #GtkScrollable:hadjustment and #GtkScrollable:vadjustment properties.
 *
 * <refsect2>
 * <title>Creating a scrollable widget</title>
 * <para>
 * There are some common things all scrollable widgets will need to do.
 *
 * <orderedlist>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <para>
 *       When parent sets adjustments, widget needs to populate adjustment's
 *       #GtkAdjustment:lower, #GtkAdjustment:upper,
 *       #GtkAdjustment:step-increment, #GtkAdjustment:page-increment and
 *       #GtkAdjustment:page-size properties and connect to
 *       #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal.
 *     </para>
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <para>
 *       When parent allocates space to child, scrollable widget needs to update
 *       properties listed under 1 with new values.
 *     </para>
 *   </listitem>
 *   <listitem>
 *     <para>
 *       When any of the adjustments emits #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal,
 *       scrollable widget needs to scroll it's contents.
